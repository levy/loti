# This script is intended to run LOTI simulations in release mode. It can be used
# only after the 'setenv' script has been run from both the OMNeT++ and the LOTI
# top level directory using the '. setenv' command. To run a simulation, simply
# go into its directory and run 'loti_release' possibly passing additional command
# line arguments. Please note that both OMNeT++ and LOTI must be compiled in release
# mode using 'make MODE=release' before.
